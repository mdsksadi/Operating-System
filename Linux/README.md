# Linux
## What is Linux?
- Linux, in simple terms, is a free and open-source operating system.
- It's similar to Windows and macOS, but it's different in several ways.
- Linux is very popular for its stability, security, and flexibility. It can be modified and distributed by anyone, which has led to many different versions, known as "distributions", and each distribution is tailored for different uses.
- Its open-sorce nature means that a community of developers and users contribute to its development.

*We just need a .iso image and need to install to go our operating system.*
### Why Learn Linux or its importance?
- Widely used in servers and cloud computing
- Free software philosophy
- Strong command line interface
- Faster processing
- Enhanced security
- Customization because of open-source nature
- Community support
- Understanding of other operation systems
- Charrier oporturnity
## History of Linux
### Before Linux
- **UNIX:** Developed in the 1970s at AT&T's Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
- **GNU Project:** In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU (GNU's Not UNIX) project (Karnel was missing)
### Birth of Linux
- **1991:** A 21-year-old Finland's student named Linus Torvalds
- On August 25, 1991, Linus announced his project on the Minix newsgroup
  - *I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like GNU")*
- **Version 0.01:** Released in 1991 (*It was not functional but public to view and comment*)
- **Version 0.02:** Released later in 1991
### Growth and Evolution
- **Early 1990s:** Linux rapidly evolved through collaboration over the Internet (*Slackware and Debian*)
- **1994:** Linux 1.0 was released with 176k lines of code
- **Late 1990s:** Commercial interest in Linux grew (*Red Hat and SUSE*)
- **2000s:** Linux saw significant adoption in server markets
- In 2007, Google released the Android OS for mobile devices which is based on Linux Kernel
### Today
- Linux has grown from a hobbyist's project into a powerful force in computing, powering everything from mobile devices, personal computers, and servers to mainframes and supercomputers.

## Linux vs. Unix
### Origins and Development
- **Unix:** Originated in the 1970s at AT&T's Bell Labs. It was developed by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others
- **Linux:** Created in the early 1990s by Linus Torvalds. It's free and open-source, meaning its source code can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone.
### OS Distribution
- **Unix:** Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, BSD etc.
- **Linux:** Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, SUSE, Kali etc.
### Licensing and Cost
- **Unix:** Generally requires a paid license, specially for commercial use
- **Linux:** Free to use, modify, and distribute
### Community and Development
- **Unix:** Development and updates are controlled by the owning organization
- **Linux:** Maintained and developed by a global community of developers
### Hardware Support
- **Unix:** Traditionally supports less hardware variety compared to Linux
- **Linux:** Known for its broad hardware support, including both traditional PCs and servers as well as embedded devices.
## Linux vs. Windows
| Feature      | Linux                                   | Windows                                     |

| Ease         | Not user-friendly                       | User friendly                               |
| Reliability  | Very reliable. Often runs for months or years | Often requires reboot                   |
| Software     | Mostly enterprise level softwares       | Much larger selection of softwares e.g., office, games, utilities etc. |
| Multi-tasking| Best for multi-tasking                  | Multi-tasking is available but with very high cpu or memory resources |
| Security     | Very secure                             | Some what secure                            |
| Open source  | Open to public                          | No an open source OS                        |
